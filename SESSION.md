## 🎯 Project status — ACTIVE (legitimate contribution building)

**LIVE:** **https://krish2248.github.io/futology/** (GitHub Pages · auto-deploys from `main` via `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)

The whole front-end is demoable end-to-end. Building legitimate contributions through real code improvements.

**Phase 0** ✅ shell complete
**Phase 1** ✅ demo-mode login + onboarding + Cmd+K. (Middleware was replaced by client-side `AuthGate` to support static export.)
**Phase 2** ✅ demo-mode data layer + StandingsTable + MatchDetailSheet (6 tabs) + per-league pages + per-club pages (6 tabs) + per-player pages + **news feed**. (API routes deleted; `lib/api/client.ts` calls demo data directly. Real RapidAPI re-introduced when we cut over to Vercel + Supabase.)
**Phase 4** ✅ all 6 intelligence sub-pages
**Phase 5** ✅ full prediction game loop, leagues, polls, leaders, notifications
**Phase 6** ✅ all 7 wishlist features (Tournament Simulator, Match Momentum, Press Intensity, Referee Bias, Weather Impact, Injury Intelligence, Odds Movement Alerts)
**Phase 7** 🔄 IN PROGRESS — ErrorBoundary ✅, Settings ✅, dark-lock indicator ✅, **GitHub Pages deploy with auto-CI workflow** ✅, **next-pwa service worker** ✅ (configured, needs testing), **Playwright E2E smoke tests** ✅ (setup complete). Outstanding: Lighthouse audit ≥ 90, Vercel + Supabase cutover.

When the user comes back to this project, start by reading `SESSION.md` and visiting the live URL. The "Next session starts here" block below has the playbook.

## 📅 Session History

### Session 7 — 2026-05-09 (skeletons + loading states + JSDoc sweep)

**Goal:** Continue Session 6 work — finish the skeleton/loading-state coverage, document hooks/stores/components/utilities, and expand the Playwright suite.

**Built (40+ atomic commits):**

*Loading skeletons (3 new components, 7 wired loading.tsx files)*
- `IntelligenceSkeleton`, `ScoresSkeleton`, `PredictionsSkeleton` components added.
- `loading.tsx` added for `/leagues`, `/clubs`, `/profile`, `/news`, `/intelligence`, `/scores`, `/predictions` — Next.js automatically streams these while route segments load.

*JSDoc sweep across hooks, stores, ML, components*
- Hooks: `useLiveScores`, `useFixtures`, `useMatchDetail`, `useStandings`, `useIsClient`.
- Stores: `useSession`, `useNotificationPreferences`, `pointsFor` settlement helper.
- Utils: `cn`, `formatEUR`, `formatEURSigned`.
- ML: `runSimulation`, `winProb`, `seeded`, `probability` (tournamentSim), `predictTransferValue` (transfer).
- Constants: `PRIMARY_NAV`, `SECONDARY_NAV`, `INTEL_FEATURES`.
- API: `isDemoMode`, `cacheHeaders`, `jsonResponse`.
- Shared components: `Card`, `StatTile`, `LiveBadge`, `EmptyState`, `PageHeader`, `Toggle`, `ErrorBoundary`, `ApiError`, `SearchModal`.
- Layout: `Navbar`, `MobileNav`, `NotificationBell`, `Providers`.
- Cards: `MatchCard`, `NewsCard`.
- Predictions: `PredictionForm`, `WinProbabilityBar`, `ScoresPicker`.

*Playwright E2E expansion*
- `homepage.spec.ts` — hero copy, live strip, CTA presence.
- `intelligence.spec.ts` — hub, match predictor, player pulse, extras hub.
- `navigation.spec.ts` — primary tabs, clubs/leagues indices, news, 404.
- `predictions.spec.ts` — page render, tab UI, AI cards.
- `scores.spec.ts` — page render, filter chips, groupings.
- `auth.spec.ts` — login form, onboarding, submit button.

**Phase 7 Progress (continued):**
- ✅ Loading skeletons fully integrated across major routes.
- ✅ JSDoc coverage now spans hooks, stores, ML, utils, constants, layout/shared/cards/predictions components.
- ✅ Playwright suite expanded from 1 → 6 spec files.
- ⏳ Lighthouse audit ≥ 90 still outstanding.
- ⏳ Vercel + Supabase cutover still outstanding.

**NEXT SESSION STARTS HERE:**
1. Run the Playwright suite locally (`npx playwright test`) and stabilise any flakes.
2. Run a Lighthouse audit on the live GH Pages URL — target ≥ 90 across all four scores. (Issue #2)
3. Decide on the Supabase + Vercel cutover (real-services migration) vs. Phase 3 (FastAPI ML service).
4. Test the next-pwa service worker on a deployed build.

### Session 5 — 2026-05-02 (final batch · news + handoff)

**Goal:** Ship the deferred news feed and put FUTOLOGY into a clean pause state. User is pivoting to a different project after this batch, so this is the handoff.

**Built:**
- `lib/data/demoNews.ts` — 18 seeded news items across 5 categories (transfers / match / analysis / injuries / tactics). Each item maps to related clubs / players / leagues so the home page can personalize. Helpers: `filterByCategory`, `isPersonalized`, `rankPersonalized`.
- `components/cards/NewsCard.tsx` — category badge with per-category accent color, "For you" pill when personalized, time-ago formatting.
- `app/news/page.tsx` + `NewsView.tsx` — full news page with category filter chips and an Everything / "For you · N" scope toggle. The For-you toggle is disabled when nothing matches.
- `app/HomeNews.tsx` — client component that ranks personalized items first, then shows top 6 on the home page.
- `app/page.tsx` — replaced the "News feed will appear here" placeholder with `<HomeNews />`. Description swaps based on whether the user follows anything.

**Verified:**
- `npx tsc --noEmit` ✓ clean
- `npm run build:export` ✓ — `/news/index.html` written under `out/`
- Live at `https://krish2248.github.io/futology/news/` after this push.

**FUTOLOGY status when paused:**

| Surface | State |
|---|---|
| Live URL | https://krish2248.github.io/futology/ |
| Repo | https://github.com/krish2248/futology (public) |
| Auto-deploy | `main` push → GH Actions → Pages |
| Total commits | ~180 (one per file/change, Conventional Commits, `sonikrish2248@gmail.com`) |
| TypeScript | strict, clean |
| Build | static export, ~80 prerendered pages |
| Bundle | 87 KB shared FLJS, predictions heaviest at 170 KB |
| Phases done | 0, 1, 4, 5, 6 (in demo mode) + Phase 2 detail pages + Phase 7 polish slice + GH Pages deploy |
| Phases outstanding | Real Supabase + RapidAPI cutover (Phases 2 & 3 backends), service worker, Playwright E2E, Lighthouse audit |

**Next session starts here (when picking FUTOLOGY back up):**

1. Read this file, then visit https://krish2248.github.io/futology/ to see current state.
2. Decide direction:
   - **(a) Real-services cutover** — install `@supabase/ssr`, apply schema from bible §6, set up Vercel deployment (separate from GH Pages so the live demo stays). Add `output: 'export'` only when `NEXT_OUTPUT=export`. Replace AuthGate + lib/api/client demo branches with real fetches. The GH Pages site stays as the public demo; Vercel becomes the authenticated production target.
   - **(b) Phase 7 polish** — `next-pwa` service worker for offline cache, Playwright smoke E2E (login → predict → settle → leaderboard), Lighthouse audit ≥ 90, bundle analysis pass.
   - **(c) Phase 3 ML service** — start the Python FastAPI service per bible §3 / §9 (XGBoost training, SHAP, sentiment pipeline). Decoupled from the front-end.

3. Demo cookie design swaps cleanly to Supabase: replace `signIn` in `lib/store/session.ts` with `supabase.auth.signInWithOtp`, keep the same store shape. Replace AuthGate's `useSession.user` check with `supabase.auth.getUser()`.

---

### Session 5 — 2026-05-02 (continued)

**Goal:** Finish the remaining 3 Phase 6 wishlist features, ship the missing Phase 2 deep pages (Player + Club), and **make this live on GitHub Pages**. The user explicitly asked for the deploy mid-batch, so the static-export refactor took priority over the news feed (deferred to next session).

**Built:**

*Phase 6 final 3 wishlist features at `/intelligence/extras/*`*
- **Press Intensity** at `/intelligence/extras/press-intensity` — `lib/data/demoPress.ts` synthesizes per-team PPDA + 12×8 pressure heatmap weighted to high/mid/low blocks. UI: zone filter chips (high/mid/low), sortable list, click any team to see their heatmap on the pitch SVG. Stat tiles for league avg PPDA + most aggressive presser.
- **Injury Intelligence** at `/intelligence/extras/injuries` — `lib/data/demoInjuries.ts` builds 0–4 injuries per team across 14 positions with severity tiers (minor/moderate/major) and per-90 contribution loss. UI: team list sorted by total impact; per-team panel shows goals impact, defense impact, clean-sheet probability delta, full injury list with expected return date.
- **Odds Movement Alerts** at `/intelligence/extras/odds` — `lib/data/demoOdds.ts` generates opening + current odds per upcoming/live fixture across 5 bookmakers, with severity escalation when implied probability shifts ≥ 12 pp. UI: severity filter (all/alert/watch/info), per-row 3-column odds card highlighting which outcome the line drifted to, alert messages.

*Phase 2 deep pages*
- **Player detail** at `/players/[playerId]` — SSG'd for all 24 seeded players. Photo placeholder, position, club, follow toggle. 8 stat tiles (goals/assists/xG/xA/key passes/pressures/pass acc./minutes), pure-SVG 10-match form area chart, predicted market value mini-card, similar-players grid, side-by-side radar with self.
- Cluster scatter detail panel now links to the full player profile.
- **Club detail** at `/clubs/[clubId]` — SSG'd for all 40 seeded clubs. Header with crest placeholder + follow toggle. 6 tabs: Overview (4-stat row + live now + up next), Squad (placeholder for Phase 2 cutover), Fixtures (upcoming MatchCards), Results (finished MatchCards), Transfers (placeholder for Phase 6 cutover), Stats (win rate + per-match goal averages).
- `app/clubs/page.tsx` — proper index now: followed clubs section + popular-club grid; cards link to detail.

*Static-export refactor (the GitHub Pages prerequisites)*
- `lib/api/client.ts` — replaced fetch-based wrappers with direct demo-data lookups wrapped in `Promise.resolve()`. Same shape as before, so all hooks (`useLiveScores`, `useFixtures`, `useStandings`, `useMatchDetail`) keep working unchanged.
- `app/api/` — **deleted** (incompatible with `output: 'export'`). The 6 routes were demo-only and never had real adapters.
- `app/intelligence/[slug]/page.tsx` — **deleted** (was dead code — all 6 features already had specific routes).
- `middleware.ts` — **deleted** (incompatible with `output: 'export'`). Auth check moved to a client component.
- `components/layout/AuthGate.tsx` — replaces middleware. After hydration, redirects unauthenticated users to `/login` from any non-public route. Allowlists `/login` and `/onboarding`.
- `app/intelligence/match/MatchPredictorView.tsx` — was POSTing to `/api/ml/predict-match`; now calls `predictMatch()` directly with a 220 ms `setTimeout` so the loading state still reads.
- `next.config.js` — gated static-export config: `output: 'export'`, `trailingSlash: true`, `images.unoptimized: true`, plus `basePath` + `assetPrefix` from `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH`. Dev still runs at `/`.
- `package.json` — added `"build:export": "cross-env NEXT_OUTPUT=export next build"` and the `cross-env` dev dep.
- `public/manifest.json` — paths now relative (`start_url: "."`, `icons[0].src: "icon.svg"`) so they survive both `/` (dev) and `/futology/` (Pages).
- `public/.nojekyll` — defense-in-depth so Pages doesn't filter `_next/` files.
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` — checkout → setup-node 22 → `npm ci` (in `futology/`) → typecheck → `npm run build:export` with `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH=/futology` → upload-pages-artifact → deploy-pages.

**Verified working — first deploy succeeded:**
- `npm run build:export` locally → ✓ 80+ static pages (incl. 40 club pages, 24 player pages, 20 league pages, 6 extras pages, 7 intelligence pages)
- Pages enabled via `gh api repos/krish2248/futology/pages -f build_type=workflow`
- Workflow run 25247717162 → **success**, deploy-pages step published the artifact
- Live smoke test (curl):
  - `https://krish2248.github.io/futology/` → 200
  - `/futology/login/` → 200
  - `/futology/intelligence/` → 200
  - `/futology/intelligence/extras/tournament-simulator/` → 200
  - `/futology/players/909/` → 200
  - `/futology/clubs/541/` → 200
- HTML asset paths confirmed prefixed: `href="/futology/_next/static/css/..."`, etc.

**Architectural note: GH Pages is the demo target. Vercel will be the cutover target.**

The live GH Pages site is the canonical demo — anyone can play with the prediction loop, intelligence pages and wishlist features without standing up Supabase or RapidAPI. When we cut over to real services we'll target Vercel because:
- Supabase Auth needs SSR cookies / route handlers (not static)
- RapidAPI keys need server-side proxy routes
- Background jobs (settlement cron, sentiment polling) need an Edge Runtime / serverless host

Plan for the cutover: keep `output: 'export'` gated so the GH Pages demo remains, add a Vercel deployment that builds without `NEXT_OUTPUT=export` (uses real API routes + middleware). Both deployments share the same code; the env flag picks the deployment shape.

**Next session starts here:**
1. Build the news feed at `/news` and wire it into the Home empty placeholder.
2. Finish remaining Phase 7 polish: `next-pwa` service worker, Playwright smoke (login → predict → settle → leaderboard), Lighthouse audit ≥ 90.
3. (Or) start the Supabase cutover on a separate Vercel target.

---

### Session 4 — 2026-05-02

**Goal:** Push into Phase 6 (wishlist) and start Phase 7 polish. Build the most-impactful four wishlist features (Tournament Simulator, Match Momentum, Referee Bias, Weather Impact), plus the polish slice that's safe to ship without external services (top-level error boundary, settings page).

**Built:**

*Phase 6 — wishlist features (`/intelligence/extras/*`)*
- `lib/constants/extras.ts` — central definition of wishlist features (4 ready, 3 still in the queue).
- `app/intelligence/extras/page.tsx` — Extras hub with feature cards. Linked from the main Intelligence Hub via a new "Extras" preview section.
- **Tournament Simulator** at `/intelligence/extras/tournament-simulator`:
  - `lib/ml/tournamentSim.ts` — ELO-based win probability with a 30-point home tilt, runs all 4 knockout rounds, aggregates to {QF %, SF %, Final %, Win %}.
  - 16-team UCL R16 seed bracket. Run options: 1k / 5k / 10k / 25k. Re-run with new RNG seed via the toolbar button.
  - Animated probability table with per-cell mini-bars. Top-4 favorite cards with crown for #1.
- **Match Momentum** at `/intelligence/extras/momentum`:
  - `lib/data/demoMomentum.ts` — per-minute xG increments rolled into a 5-minute window; counts swing crossings.
  - Pure-SVG dual-area chart: home above center, away below center. Goal markers vertical lines.
  - Stat tiles: peak home/away xG (with minute), total swings, window length.
- **Referee Bias** at `/intelligence/extras/referee-bias`:
  - `lib/data/demoReferees.ts` — 14 referees across 6 leagues. Per-ref cards/match plus big-game-only cards/match. Sortable.
  - Toggle for "big games only", which recomputes the table. Big-game delta column shows arrow + percentage. Home tilt index (50 = neutral, ≥54 H, ≤46 A).
- **Weather Impact** at `/intelligence/extras/weather`:
  - `lib/data/demoWeather.ts` — 5 weather buckets (clear / rain / heat / wind / cold) × 5 leagues. Each split has matches, home/draw/away rates, goals/match.
  - League filter chips (All / EPL / La Liga / Bundesliga / Serie A / Ligue 1). Per-bucket card with stacked horizontal bar and Δ-vs-baseline pp delta.

*Phase 7 — polish slice*
- `components/shared/ErrorBoundary.tsx` — class-based React error boundary with retry. Wired around `<main>` in the root layout.
- `lib/store/preferences.ts` — separate Zustand persist slice for notification toggles + email toggle. Bible §6 mirrors `profiles.notifications_enabled` etc.
- `components/shared/Toggle.tsx` — accessible switch with `role="switch"` and `aria-checked`.
- `app/profile/settings/page.tsx` + `SettingsView.tsx` — settings sections for notifications (5 toggles), email, theme (locked-dark indicator), danger zone with reset-session confirmation.
- `ProfileView.tsx` — Settings card is now a real link to `/profile/settings`.

**Verified working:**
- `npx tsc --noEmit` → clean
- `npx next build` → 31 routes total (added: extras hub + 4 features + settings)
- Smoke test on dev server (3005):
  - `/intelligence/extras` → 200 / 36 KB
  - `/intelligence/extras/tournament-simulator` → 200 / 56 KB (largest demo page; 10k Monte Carlo runs at render)
  - `/intelligence/extras/momentum` → 200 / 30 KB
  - `/intelligence/extras/referee-bias` → 200 / 35 KB
  - `/intelligence/extras/weather` → 200 / 28 KB
  - `/profile/settings` → 200 / 25 KB
- Bundle still well under budget: extras pages are 28–56 KB and stay under 145 KB FLJS.

**Architectural note: Tournament Simulator runs client-side.**

Each render runs N Monte Carlo iterations on the main thread. At 10,000 runs × 15 matches/run = 150k ELO probability evaluations, this is fast enough to feel instant (~80–120 ms on modern hardware), but if we ever crank up to 100k+ runs we should move it to a Web Worker. The function in `lib/ml/tournamentSim.ts` is pure and side-effect-free, so a worker port is mechanical: post `{ runs, seed, bracket }`, receive `SimulationOutcome`. Logged here so the Phase 7 perf pass can spot it.

**Next session starts here:**
1. Read `SESSION.md`. Phase 6 has 3 wishlist features remaining (Press Intensity, Injury Intelligence, Odds Movement Alerts) — all doable without external keys.
2. Decide between three reasonable next moves:
   - **(a) Finish Phase 7** — install `next-pwa` for the service worker, write Playwright smoke tests (login → predict → settle → leaderboard), bundle analysis pass, Lighthouse aim ≥90, write `pre_deploy_check.ts`, deploy ML stub to Railway and frontend to Vercel.
   - **(b) Begin Supabase cutover** — install `@supabase/ssr`, apply schema, swap `signIn` and `middleware.ts` first, then start migrating `predictions[]`/`predictionLeagues[]` to real tables. Each demo route's `if (isDemoMode)` branch swaps independently.
   - **(c) Finish Phase 6** — build Press Intensity Heatmap (PPDA-driven, lifts data from existing TacticBoard demo), Injury Intelligence (impact model with seeded injuries), Odds Movement Alert (flag suspicious odds shifts).

---

### Session 3 — 2026-05-01 (continued, second batch)

**Goal:** Stand up the full predictions game loop end-to-end. Make a prediction → auto-settle when the match finishes → climb the leaderboard. All in demo mode against the Zustand store; structured so the Supabase swap is one-to-one with bible §6.

**Built:**
- Extended `lib/store/session.ts` to v2 with predictions, leagues, poll votes and notifications. Includes `migrate` step so existing v1 sessions don't lose their followed lists.
- `components/predictions/ScoresPicker.tsx` — big-button score picker with 0–9 clamp.
- `components/predictions/PredictionForm.tsx` — used both inline (in the sheet's Predict tab) and reusable. ML hint chip, confetti on save, locks after kickoff.
- New 6th tab in `MatchDetailSheet`: **Predict**. Pre-fills with existing prediction.
- `components/predictions/MyPredictions.tsx` — auto-settlement effect, upcoming/settled split, edit-via-sheet, +3/+1/0 colored result indicator.
- `components/predictions/PredictionLeagues.tsx` — Create / Join modals, public-leagues seed, league detail with full leaderboard, copy-invite, leave-league.
- `components/predictions/CommunityTab.tsx` — 3 polls with vote-once and animated bar fills, trending predictions, accuracy leaders.
- `lib/data/demoLeagues.ts` — 3 seeded public leagues (Global, EPL Picks, UCL Bracket) with synthetic member rosters.
- `lib/data/demoCommunity.ts` — polls (EPL winner / UCL winner / Ballon d'Or) + 3 trending picks + 10 accuracy leaders.
- Updated `PredictionCard` (AI tab): "Use this prediction" now actually saves to the user's store, with confetti and "Saved"/"Update from ML" states.
- Updated `NotificationBell` to consume the real store notifications, with seed fallback when empty and a real `mark all read`.

**Verified working:**
- `npx tsc --noEmit` → clean
- `npx next build` → all routes still build (predictions: 12.5 KB / 167 KB FLJS, the heaviest page in the app — includes the sheet, leagues UI, polls)
- Smoke test on dev server (3004): `/predictions` → 200/50 KB. Match detail API confirms fixture #4 is `finished` with `2-1` so auto-settlement has a real input to test against.

**Architecture: settlement contract**

Auto-settlement happens in `MyPredictions` via a `useEffect` over `useFixtures()`. When a fixture transitions to `finished`, the store's `settlePrediction({ fixtureId, actualHomeScore, actualAwayScore })` runs and:
1. Computes points (3 = exact, 1 = correct winner, 0 = miss)
2. Marks the prediction settled
3. Pushes a `prediction_settled` notification
4. `queueMicrotask`s a `recomputeLeagueStats()` so leaderboards update.

Phase 5 cutover for settlement just replaces the trigger: instead of running on render, a Supabase Edge Function runs on a cron, polling finished fixtures from API-Football and updating the `predictions` and `prediction_league_members` tables. The 3/1/0 logic is identical — currently lives in `pointsFor` in `lib/store/session.ts` and can be lifted as-is.

**Next session starts here:**
1. Read `SESSION.md`. The full app is now a working demo end-to-end.
2. Decide between three reasonable next moves:
   - **(a) Begin Supabase cutover** — install `@supabase/ssr`, apply schema, swap auth + persistence one piece at a time. Start with auth (`signIn` → `signInWithOtp`), then move to predictions (Zustand → Supabase tables with RLS).
   - **(b) Build Phase 6 wishlist features** — Match Momentum (rolling xG), Referee Bias Analyzer, Weather Impact Model, Press Intensity Heatmap, Tournament Simulator, Injury Intelligence, Odds Movement Alerts.
   - **(c) Build Phase 7 polish** — proper PWA service worker via `next-pwa`, demo-mode seed bundles, Lighthouse audit pass, Playwright smoke E2E, deploy script.
3. Whatever the choice, the demo→real swap is a one-line change inside each `route.ts` and inside `signIn`/`middleware.ts` — the rest of the app is contract-stable.

---

### Session 2 — 2026-05-01

**Goal:** Establish the data layer that Phase 2/3/4 will plug into. Build it on demo data first so `/scores`, `/leagues/[id]`, match details, and the Match Predictor all work end-to-end without external keys. When real keys land, only the inside of each `route.ts` changes.

**Built:**
- TanStack Query v5 + `Providers` wrapper in root layout (staleTime 30 s, gcTime 5 min, retry 1, no refocus refetch — per bible Phase 7)
- Demo API routes mirroring bible §10:
  - `GET /api/football/live-scores?status=&league=`
  - `GET /api/football/fixtures?status=&league=&team=`
  - `GET /api/football/match/[fixtureId]` — full detail (events, stats, lineups, H2H)
  - `GET /api/football/standings?league=` — rows + bands + league meta
  - `GET /api/football/search?q=&type=`
  - `POST /api/ml/predict-match` — body `{ home_id, away_id, competition_id }`
  - All set Cache-Control per bible (`no-store` for live, `s-maxage=300` for fixtures/standings, `s-maxage=3600` for finished/team/player/search). Returns `{ data, demo: true|false }`.
- `lib/api/config.ts` — central `isDemoMode`, cache-header table, `jsonResponse` helper
- `lib/api/client.ts` — typed `api.{liveScores,fixtures,match,standings,search}` consumed by hooks
- `hooks/useLiveScores.ts` — exports `useLiveScores` (30 s poll), `useFixtures`, `useMatchDetail`, `useStandings`
- `lib/data/demoMatchDetail.ts` — synthesizes events/stats/lineups (4-3-3 with normalised pitch coords)/H2H
- `lib/data/demoStandings.ts` — deterministic 16-team standings with bands per league
- `lib/ml/predictor.ts` — seeded match-prediction function (home advantage + tier bonus + 3 plain-English factors)
- `components/cards/StandingsTable.tsx` — sortable visually with European spots / relegation color bands, position arrows, form W/D/L pills, responsive hide-on-narrow columns, legend footer
- `components/cards/MatchDetailSheet.tsx` — slide-up on mobile, side-sheet on desktop. 5 tabs:
  - **Overview** — venue, referee, attendance, goalscorers
  - **Stats** — bidirectional bars (possession, shots, xG, corners, fouls, cards) with dominant-side highlight
  - **Lineups** — accurate-proportion pitch SVG with 22 player dots in 4-3-3 + lineup lists
  - **Events** — chronological timeline with home/left, away/right alignment
  - **H2H** — last 5 meetings + win-tally pills
- `components/intelligence/TeamPicker.tsx` — searchable team selector with click-outside + ESC
- `app/intelligence/match/page.tsx` + `MatchPredictorView.tsx` — full Match Predictor: two team pickers, animated probability bar, predicted score, confidence pill, key factors. Specific route takes precedence over the dynamic `[slug]` placeholder.
- `app/leagues/[leagueId]/page.tsx` — SSG'd for all 20 league IDs, hosts the StandingsTable. `/leagues` index page now lists every league as a clickable card.
- `app/HomeLive.tsx` — pulled the home page's live-strip into a client component fed by TanStack Query so it auto-refreshes without making the whole page client.
- `components/shared/ApiError.tsx` — designed error state with retry CTA used by all data-driven views.
- `components/providers/Providers.tsx` — QueryClientProvider with the Phase 7 defaults.
- Refactored `ScoresView`, `HomePage`, `LeagueDetailView` to fetch via the API + TanStack Query; click any MatchCard or LiveStrip card → opens `MatchDetailSheet`.

**Verified working:**
- `npx tsc --noEmit` → clean
- `npx next build` → 24 routes (6 dynamic API routes, 20 SSG league pages, intel/match static, all others static), middleware 25.6 KB
- Smoke test on dev server (port 3002):
  - `GET /api/football/live-scores?status=live` → 200, returns 3 live demo matches
  - `GET /api/football/standings?league=39` → 200, full Premier League table with bands
  - `GET /api/football/search?q=barcelona` → 200, returns the club + 3 Barcelona players
  - `GET /api/football/match/1` → 200, full detail with events/stats/lineups/H2H
  - `POST /api/ml/predict-match {home_id:541, away_id:529}` → 200, "predictedScore":"3-2", confidence 46%
  - `GET /leagues/39` → 200/19 KB (StandingsTable rendered)
  - `GET /intelligence/match` → 200/21 KB (Match Predictor rendered)

**Architectural choice — intentional swap point:**

Each `route.ts` has a single `if (isDemoMode)` branch returning seeded data. Phase 2 cutover will replace just the body of that branch with a `fetch` to RapidAPI / Supabase / the FastAPI ML service — the route signature, response envelope (`{ data, demo }`) and Cache-Control header all stay the same. The hooks (`useLiveScores`, `useStandings`, `useMatchDetail`) and components don't change.

Same for `/api/ml/predict-match` — the body branch swaps to a `fetch` to the FastAPI ML service authenticated by `ML_SERVICE_TOKEN`. Until then, `lib/ml/predictor.ts` simulates the same return shape as the bible §9.1 spec (home/draw/away probs, predicted score, confidence, key factors).

**Built (continued, same calendar day):**
- All 5 remaining intelligence pages (Player Pulse, Sentiment Storm, TacticBoard, Transfer Oracle, Fantasy IQ) — see Phase Tracker above for the full per-feature breakdown.
- Pure-SVG charts everywhere (no Recharts/Plotly yet) — keeps bundle small. When the real ML service lands, the chart shapes are already exact.
- Components added: `PlayerClusterChart`, `ClusterFilter`, `PlayerComparisonRadar`, `PlayerPicker`, `SentimentTimeline`, `SentimentGauge`, `PitchSVG` (+ `PitchMarker`), `FantasyPitch`.
- Demo data added: `playerClusters.ts` (6 cluster profiles per bible §9.2), `demoPlayerStats.ts` (per-90 stats with seeded PCA-derived axes + `nearestPlayers` + `toRadar`), `demoSentiment.ts` (90-min sentiment walk + reaction sampler), `demoTactics.ts` (xG shots + pass network), `demoFantasy.ts` (FANTASY_POOL + greedy `optimizeFantasy`).
- ML helpers: `lib/ml/transfer.ts` produces a SHAP-style factor breakdown around a base value derived from position, goals, xG, assists, passing, pressing, minutes.

**Verified working (final):**
- `npx tsc --noEmit` → clean
- `npx next build` → 26 routes (6 dynamic API + 6 intelligence sub-pages + 20 SSG league pages + the standard set), ~145 KB FLJS for the heaviest intel page
- Smoke test on dev server (3003): every intel sub-page returns 200 with expected size:
  - `/intelligence/match` — 21 KB
  - `/intelligence/players` — 33 KB
  - `/intelligence/sentiment` — 35 KB
  - `/intelligence/tactics` — 32 KB
  - `/intelligence/transfer` — 20 KB
  - `/intelligence/fantasy` — 22 KB

**Next session starts here:**
1. Read `SESSION.md`. The whole front-end is demoable end-to-end.
2. Decide: cut over to real services, OR build Phase 5 (predictions settlement, prediction leagues, community polls, email notifications).
3. **If cutting over:**
   - Install `@supabase/supabase-js`, `@supabase/ssr`. Add `lib/supabase/{client,server,middleware}.ts`.
   - Apply schema from bible §6 in the Supabase SQL editor. Generate `types/database.ts`.
   - Replace `lib/store/session.ts#signIn` with `supabase.auth.signInWithOtp`. Update `middleware.ts` to call `supabase.auth.getUser()`.
   - One route at a time: replace each `if (isDemoMode)` branch with a `fetch` to RapidAPI / FastAPI ML service. The signatures and envelopes are already correct.
4. **If building Phase 5:**
   - Predictions form (make a prediction, store in `predictions` table).
   - Cron settlement (Edge Function) on finished fixtures.
   - Prediction leagues (create / join / leaderboard).
   - Community polls + Supabase Realtime subscription.
   - Resend email digest.

### Session 1 — 2026-04-30

**Goal:** Read the project bible. Scaffold the Next.js project. Configure dark-only design system. Build a navigable shell so the next session can start filling in real features.

**Decisions made:**
- Project lives at `C:\Users\sonik\Desktop\Sick-Boy\futology` (sub-folder, keeps the bible at the root).
- `npm` instead of `pnpm` (npm 11 already installed; avoids extra install step). Can switch later.
- Skipping `npx create-next-app` — scaffolding manually for predictable, non-interactive setup on Windows.
- Building Phase 0 + the layout shell from Phase 1 in one go so the user has a clickable, navigable UI by end of session.
- Skipping Husky/lint-staged/CI for session 1 — not in a git repo yet, and nothing to gate. Will revisit when remote is set up.

**Built this session (33 files):**

*Project scaffolding (`futology/`)*
- `package.json` — Next 14.2.18 + React 18 + Tailwind 3.4 + TS 5.6 + lucide-react + clsx/tailwind-merge
- `tsconfig.json` — strict, `@/*` path alias
- `next.config.js` — image remote hosts for API-Football, football-data, Transfermarkt
- `postcss.config.js`, `tailwind.config.ts` — full dark-only color tokens (bg, accent, premium, live, text), keyframes (live-pulse, fade-in, shimmer)
- `.gitignore`, `.eslintrc.json`, `.env.example` (every key from bible §7), `next-env.d.ts`

*Design system & layout*
- `app/globals.css` — base resets, dark scrollbar, focus rings, `.surface` / `.live-dot` / `.skeleton` / `.tabular` / `.container-page` / `.safe-bottom` utilities, `prefers-reduced-motion` honored
- `app/layout.tsx` — Inter via `next/font/google`, `<html className="dark">`, skip-to-content link, sticky Navbar, fixed MobileNav
- `lib/utils/cn.ts` — clsx + tailwind-merge
- `lib/constants/navigation.ts` — single source of truth for primary 5-tab nav + secondary nav
- `lib/constants/intelligence.ts` — 6 intel features (slug, title, tagline, description, icon)
- `components/layout/Navbar.tsx` — desktop top nav with primary + secondary links, search/bell stubs
- `components/layout/MobileNav.tsx` — bottom 5-tab nav with safe-area insets, 44px tap targets, scale-95 active feedback
- `components/shared/PageHeader.tsx` — title + description + optional action
- `components/shared/Card.tsx` — surface vs. surface-elevated, optional hover glow
- `components/shared/EmptyState.tsx` — icon + title + description + optional action (centered)
- `components/shared/LiveBadge.tsx` — full vs. dot variant, both pulse
- `components/shared/StatTile.tsx` — label / value / hint, tabular numerals

*Pages (12 total, all prerendered static)*
- `app/page.tsx` — hero + Live-Now placeholder + 3 quick-link cards + 4-stat snapshot + News placeholder
- `app/scores/page.tsx` — All/Live/Finished/Scheduled filter tabs + empty state
- `app/predictions/page.tsx` — 4 tabs (AI/Mine/Leagues/Community) + 4-stat row + ML preview card
- `app/intelligence/page.tsx` — 6-card hub + 4-stat model performance row
- `app/intelligence/[slug]/page.tsx` — single dynamic placeholder for all 6 intel sub-pages (statically generated for match/players/sentiment/tactics/transfer/fantasy)
- `app/profile/page.tsx` — guest header + sign-in CTA + 4-stat row + settings card
- `app/clubs/page.tsx`, `app/leagues/page.tsx`, `app/tournaments/page.tsx` — header + empty state
- `app/not-found.tsx` — 404 with home CTA
- `app/loading.tsx` — global skeleton (header + 4 tiles + main panel)

*Repo metadata*
- `SESSION.md` — this file (project root, alongside the bible)
- Memory files saved at `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/`: user profile, project, session workflow, UI direction

**Verified working:**
- `npm install` → 391 packages, no errors.
- `npx tsc --noEmit` → clean (no output = no errors).
- `npx next build` → ✓ compiled, all 17 routes prerendered static, first-load JS 87–94 KB.
- `npx next dev` smoke test (curl):
  - `GET /` → 200 (41 KB)
  - `GET /intelligence` → 200 (43 KB)
  - `GET /intelligence/match` → 200 (21 KB)
  - `GET /this-does-not-exist` → 404 (correctly returns the not-found page)
- Dev server cleanly stopped (PID 28184 killed).

**Blocked / deferred:**
- **Supabase project + schema (bible §6):** can't apply schema until the user creates a Supabase project. Listed in External Accounts table. Phase 1 auth flow is blocked on this.
- **Husky / lint-staged / Conventional Commits / GitHub Actions CI:** deferred — the repo isn't on GitHub yet. Will set up after the per-file commits push lands.
- **Real shadcn/ui components:** the bible names shadcn primitives (Button, Sheet, Tabs, Dialog, etc.). I've built the equivalents inline as plain Tailwind components for now (Card, EmptyState, StatTile). When we hit Phase 1 auth UI, we'll either install shadcn or keep going with our own — decide then.
- **Framer Motion / TanStack Query / Zustand / Recharts / Plotly:** not installed yet. Will install per phase as features land (auth doesn't need any of them; live scores will need TanStack Query).

**Session 1 part 2 additions (continued working):**

*Auth, onboarding, route protection*
- `lib/store/session.ts` — Zustand store with localStorage persist; sets `futology_session` cookie on sign in; `signIn`, `signOut`, `completeOnboarding`, `toggleLeague/Club/Player/Tournament`, `reset`. Designed so swapping in Supabase changes only the persistence layer.
- `hooks/useHydratedSession.ts` — `useIsClient()` to avoid SSR hydration mismatch on persisted state.
- `middleware.ts` — gate every dashboard route on `futology_session` cookie; allowlist `/login` and `/onboarding`; preserve a `?next=` redirect target.
- `app/login/page.tsx` — Framer-animated three-state flow (form → sent → ready) with email validation. Sets the demo session.
- `app/onboarding/page.tsx` — three-step wizard: leagues (20) → clubs (40+, debounced search) → players (24) + tournaments (10). Progress bar springs, step transitions slide, confetti fires on completion.

*Seed data (`lib/data/`)*
- `leagues.ts` — 20 leagues with API-Football IDs (matches bible §11 Phase 1)
- `clubs.ts` — 40+ clubs across the top 6 leagues, with `clubsByLeague`, `findClub`, and `CLUB_QUICK_PICKS`
- `players.ts` — 24 star players with positions and nationalities
- `tournaments.ts` — 10 majors (World Cup, Euros, Copa, AFCON, Asian Cup, CWC, plus domestic cups)
- `demoMatches.ts` — relative-time-based matches: 3 live, 4 finished, 11 scheduled across 6 leagues; helpers for filter & league grouping
- `demoPredictions.ts` — deterministic ML-style predictions (home/draw/away probabilities, predicted score, confidence, key factors)

*Components*
- `components/cards/MatchCard.tsx` — three implicit variants via match status; LiveStrip wrapper for horizontal scroll on Home
- `components/predictions/WinProbabilityBar.tsx` — segmented bar with dominant-side accent
- `components/predictions/PredictionCard.tsx` — ML badge, prob bar, predicted-score trio, expandable key factors, "Use this prediction" + "Save"
- `components/shared/SearchModal.tsx` — Cmd+K / `/` shortcut, debounced 300 ms, keyboard nav, 4 tabs (All/Teams/Players/Leagues), recent in localStorage
- `components/layout/NotificationBell.tsx` — popover with unread count, mark-all-read, click-outside + Esc to close
- `lib/utils/format.ts` — `formatKickoff`, `formatScore`, `formatRelativeMinute`

*Wired pages*
- `/` — hero + live strip pulling 3 live demo matches
- `/scores` — filter tabs (All/Live/Finished/Scheduled with counts), grouped by league, MatchCard everywhere
- `/predictions` — AI tab now shows 8 PredictionCards with deterministic seeded data; other tabs are designed empty states pointing at later phases
- `/profile` — real user from Zustand, sign-out wired, follow counts and previews from store

*PWA*
- `public/manifest.json`, `public/icon.svg`, `app/icon.svg` for the App Router favicon convention, `public/robots.txt`
- `metadata.manifest = "/manifest.json"` in `app/layout.tsx`

**Verified working (final smoke test):**
- `npx next build` → 20 static routes, middleware 25.6 KB. Login 4.45 KB / 143 KB FLJS, onboarding 10.3 KB / 150 KB.
- `npx tsc --noEmit` → clean.
- Dev server smoke test:
  - `GET /` (no cookie) → **307** redirect to `/login` ✓
  - `GET /login` → 200 ✓
  - `GET /onboarding` → 200 ✓
  - `GET /scores` (with `futology_session` cookie) → 200 (39 KB) ✓
  - `GET /predictions` (with cookie) → 200 (52 KB) ✓

**Next session starts here:**

1. Read `SESSION.md`. Confirm Phase 1 demo-mode is in place.
2. Ask the user for: Supabase project URL + anon key + service role, API-Football RapidAPI key, NewsAPI key, Reddit credentials.
3. **Cut over from demo to real:**
   - Install `@supabase/supabase-js`, `@supabase/ssr`, `@tanstack/react-query`.
   - Add `lib/supabase/{client,server,middleware}.ts`.
   - Apply the schema from bible §6 in the Supabase SQL editor; generate `types/database.ts` via `supabase gen types`.
   - Replace `signIn` in `lib/store/session.ts` with a call to `supabase.auth.signInWithOtp`.
   - Replace `middleware.ts` cookie check with `supabase.auth.getUser()` from `@supabase/ssr`.
   - Persist follows to `user_followed_*` tables instead of localStorage.
4. **Phase 2 — live data:**
   - `app/api/football/{live-scores,fixtures,standings,team/[teamId],match/[fixtureId],search}/route.ts` — proxy API-Football, never expose key. Cache-Control per route per bible §10.
   - `lib/api/football.ts` helpers: `getCurrentSeason`, `formatFixture`, `formatStandings`, `formatPlayer`.
   - `hooks/useLiveScores.ts` with TanStack Query and 30 s polling.
   - Swap `getDemoMatches()` calls for live data hooks.
   - Build the MatchDetailSheet (5 tabs) per bible §2.1.
   - Build StandingsTable for `/leagues/[leagueId]`.
5. Run lint + typecheck + build before declaring Phase 2 done.

## 📐 Design Principles (locked in)

1. **Dark mode only.** No theme toggle. `#0A0A0A` background, `#00D563` accent, `#FFD700` premium, `#FF3B3B` live.
2. **Mobile-first.** Test at 375px before considering anything done.
3. **Minimal & navigable.** Per user direction in session 1: keep UI simple and easy to navigate. No clutter; clear hierarchy; bottom-tab nav on mobile, top nav on desktop.
4. **Functional over fancy.** Skeleton loaders, empty states, error states are required, not optional.
5. **TypeScript strict.** No `any`, no `@ts-ignore`.

### Planned (PROJECT_Sick-Boy.md §5)
See bible §5 for the full target structure. We're building it incrementally per phase.

## 🐛 Known Issues / Tech Debt

- **Demo Supabase shim.** The login flow currently sets a `futology_session` cookie and stores user state in localStorage via Zustand. When the user provides Supabase keys, swap `lib/store/session.ts#signIn` to call `supabase.auth.signInWithOtp` and replace the cookie with the Supabase SSR session cookie. The middleware.ts contract (cookie present = authenticated) is intentionally swap-compatible.
- **Demo data branches in API routes.** Each handler in `app/api/**` has a single `if (isDemoMode)` branch returning seeded data. Replacing the body of that branch with a `fetch` to RapidAPI / FastAPI is the entire Phase-2/3 cutover for that route. The route signature, response envelope (`{ data, demo }`) and Cache-Control header all stay the same.
- **PredictionCard demo path on `/predictions`.** Still imports from `lib/data/demoPredictions` directly. Should be migrated to `/api/ml/predict-batch` (POST `[fixture_ids]`) once that endpoint exists.
- **NotificationBell uses 3 hard-coded notifications.** Replace with a Supabase Realtime subscription on `notifications` table in Phase 5.
- **`SearchModal` reads `lib/data/*` directly.** Could be migrated to `/api/football/search` for consistency, but the current local search is already debounced and fast — defer until there's a reason.
- **Inline Tailwind components stand in for shadcn/ui primitives.** Working fine; decision deferred — install shadcn for the Sheet/Tabs/Dialog primitives in Phase 2 if a feature needs them, otherwise stay custom.

## 📝 Quick-Start for Next Session

**Tell Claude (or yourself) at the start of next session:**

> Read `SESSION.md` first, then `PROJECT_Sick-Boy.md`. Resume from "Next session starts here" in the latest session entry. Do not re-do work that's already ticked off in the Phase Tracker.

**To run the dev server:**

```bash
cd "C:/Users/sonik/Desktop/Sick-Boy/futology"
npm install   # only if node_modules missing
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:3000.

**To check the build:**

```bash
cd "C:/Users/sonik/Desktop/Sick-Boy/futology"
npm run build
```
